### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Jordan and I think I might be a software developer :)

#### Open projects:
  - Death is a Blessing (game concept, paused due to burnout)
  - zxd (xxd clone in zig, slowly ongoing)
  - zbg (backgammon engine and api written in zig, paused for now)

#### Recently finished:
  - conway's game of life (implemented in zig, poorly. will go back sometime soon and refactor)
  - [business card raytracer](https://github.com/BoundlessCarrot/simple-raytracer) (the famous one, rewritten in zig. need to go back and properly refactor it though)
